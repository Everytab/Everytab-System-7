# Project Apollo
The branch of ES/7 dedicated for a custom FreeDOS kernel


TODO : Insert FreeDOS instructions here



How to use (compiling ES/7)

Get DOSBox
set the work environment in a folder having Visual Basic for MS-DOS (Use VBDOS.7Z)

**How to compile**
Open VBDOS, then go to file > add file and select the desired bas file (REMEMBER, MAKE SURE ONLY ONE BAS FILE IS LOADED WHILE COMPILING)
go to run > Make an exe
Select - no debug, no need of runtime and i486 maths
Compile and see the exe in the same directory as VBDOS

**How to make an install**

Requirements
1) Compiled ESSM2.bas and CDST.bas
2) PowerISO

Steps
1) Modify the ES7.zip and replace the needed files
2) Modify the boot image file of the ISO (option in PowerISO) and add CDST

Put test releases in the Releases tab

I will check and transfer to the public page

Files which are depricated (Useless)

- ST1 to 4 (Use CDST)
- UP1 and 2 (Use CDST)
- ES and ESSM (Use ESSM2)
